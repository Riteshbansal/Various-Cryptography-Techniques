# [Analysis of Various Cryptography Techniques: A Survey](http://www.earticle.net/Article.aspx?sn=281862)
>Advancement in digital technologies has resulted in increased data transfer over internet in recent years. As a result, security of images/data is one of the biggest concern of many researchers. Therefore several cryptographic schemes have been proposed for image/data encryption. An efficient cryptographic scheme is one that have high brute force search time, low execution time complexity and should be able to provide good security. In this paper, several ciphers (traditional as well as modern) for images are compared based on various parameters such as: Time complexity, Peak Signal to Noise Ratio (PSNR), Number of Pixels Change Rate (NPCR), Unified Average Changing Intensity (UACI) and Entropy. In addition, the paper also shows the shortcomings of traditional ciphers that were used for text and how modern ciphers overcome this limitations. The analysis of simulation result shows that chaotic encryption schemes are most efficient and better than others.
